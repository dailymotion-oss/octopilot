If you want to see what you can do with Octopilot for real, here is a set of real-world use-cases that we have at [Dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com/):

- [Promoting a new application release](#use-case-app-promotion) with a gitops workflow
- [Promoting a new library release](#use-case-lib-promotion) to a dynamic list of application repositories
- [Updating certificates](#use-case-update-certs) with a gitops workflow
- [Updating Go dependencies](#use-case-go-deps)
- [Previsualizing changes](#use-case-preview) done by octopilot, without pushing to the remote GitHub repository
